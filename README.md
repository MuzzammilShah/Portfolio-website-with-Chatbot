#### **📢Disclaimer:**

The site has been designed to best view on either a Laptop or Desktop. And the Chatbot servers has been turned off due to the Memory Limit being exceeded that was provided by the hosting service.

**However, If you wish to see the chatbot's functionality please feel free to contact me. I'd be more than happy to show you a demo**
